          Akatsuki (暁, literally meaning: "Dawn" or "Daybreak") was a group of
          shinobi that existed outside the usual system of hidden villages. Over
          the course of several decades, Akatsuki took different forms and was
          led by different individuals. The initial concept of Akatsuki was
          devised by Black Zetsu as part of its plan to revive its mother,
          though it pretended the idea came from Madara Uchiha, whom Black Zetsu
          tricked into thinking that it was a manifestation of his will.[1]
          Akatsuki was originally founded by Yahiko during the Third Shinobi
          World War alongside his childhood friends, Nagato and Konan. As
          citizens of Amegakure who had been orphaned by the Second Shinobi
          World War, the three created Akatsuki as a way to bring peace to their
          home country, which too often got caught in the crossfire of the Five
          Great Shinobi Countries' many conflicts.[2] In time, the three were
          approached by Tobi, who introduced himself as Madara Uchiha.[3] Tobi
          claimed Nagato was the reincarnation of the Sage of Six Paths and
          offered to teach him to control the power of his Rinnegan, though
          Yahiko distrusted him and prompted Nagato to turn down his offer.[4]
          Nevertheless, Tobi would later claim that it was he who encouraged
          Yahiko to form Akatsuki, unbeknownst to Konan.[5]
